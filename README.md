# tiny-pov

A Persistence of Vision, or PoV, device using `ATTiny` and a GPIO expander,
`MCP23017`
((datasheet)[https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/20001952c.pdf]).

The project is intended for students who have mastered Arduino basics. The
code is small, and includes some advanced topics, such as `PROGMEM`, using
external libraries, `platformio` build system, and `I2C`.
